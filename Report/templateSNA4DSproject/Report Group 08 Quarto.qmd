## Introduction

### Common Ground: The Relationship Between Governance and Trade

The global trade network is a core foundation of the modern economy, enabling countries to
exchange goods, services, and capital in ways that drive productivity and long-term
growth. International trade is shaped not only by economic fundamentals but also by the
governance environments in which countries operate. Understanding how governance
similarity shapes bilateral trade is essential, as institutional alignment can enhance
regulatory predictability and foster trust, thereby amplifying trade volumes and
strengthening economic integration. This research specifically investigates how governance
similarity between nations influences the strength of their bilateral trade relations.

Building on evidence that institutional quality, corruption control, and regulatory
effectiveness significantly shape trade performance, this study applies the Multiple
Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure (MRQAP) and the Generalized Exponential Random
Graph Model (GERGM) to capture structural interdependencies and trade intensity within the
global trade network. By modeling trade as a weighted network, this research provides a
more accurate understanding of how governance characteristics shape the magnitude of
international trade flows, addressing gaps left by prior network analyses.

Empirical studies consistently demonstrate that governance conditions affect bilateral
trade costs and export performance. Evidence from [@de_groot_institutional_2004] shows
that countries with similar institutional frameworks trade approximately 13% more with
each other, while improvements in overall institutional quality can increase bilateral
trade volumes by 30–44%. Research from [@sabry_arab-german_2022], examining Arab exports
to Germany, similarly finds that regulatory quality and government effectiveness drive
export performance, although the magnitude of these effects varies across regions and
industries, such as textiles. Likewise, [@landry_does_2024] reports that improvements in
corruption control and democratic governance increase African exports to Western partners,
but do not produce the same effect in trade with China.

Further evidence reinforces these governance effects.
[@university_of_economic_studies_bucharest_romania_governance_2021] using an augmented
gravity model for Romanian–EU trade, finds that regulatory quality has the strongest
positive impact on exports, while weak institutional performance limits deeper trade
integration. [@didier_characterising_2021] documents asymmetric governance effects in
Sub-Saharan African trade with China: stronger governance enhances Chinese exports to
Africa, whereas weaker governance, particularly higher corruption, can facilitate African
exports to China.

### Complication: The Network Structure Problem

Despite this evidence, most studies rely on gravity models that assume independence across
trade pairs and overlook interdependencies in the global trade network, such as
reciprocity, clustering, and transitivity. To address this, recent research has adopted
Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs), which explicitly account for relational
dependencies and allow structural, political, and economic factors to be assessed
simultaneously [@noauthor_inferential_nodate; @schweitzer_economic_2009]. For example,
[@noauthor_analysis_nodate] applies ERGMs to the global wheat trade and shows that
reciprocity, GDP, and geographic proximity shape tie formation, while
[@setayesh_analysis_2022] finds that GDP, distance, diplomatic exchanges, and landlocked
status influence trade relations, with transitivity adding explanatory power beyond dyadic
predictors.

However, existing ERGM applications often rely on backbone extraction methods such as the
disparity filter [@serrano_extracting_2009] to convert weighted networks to binary ones.
While this simplifies estimation, it discards important information on trade intensity,
limiting the detection of variation in export strength and obscuring key patterns of
economic interdependence, especially among closely integrated or institutionally aligned
countries. As [@setayesh_analysis_2022] note, studies should “observe the global trade
network as a weighted network without applying backbone methods” to capture both the
presence and magnitude of trade ties accurately.

### Concern

To address this gap, the present study employs GERGM, developed by
[@desmarais_statistical_2012], which extends ERGM methodology to networks with
continuous-valued edges. GERGM models endogenous network dependencies, including
reciprocity, transitivity, and clustering, while incorporating edge weights that represent
trade intensity. This approach enables a comprehensive representation of the global trade
system as both structurally interdependent and quantitatively differentiated, capturing
not only whether trade ties exist but also their relative economic significance.
Additionally, most prior research focuses on region- or sector-specific cases, limiting
global generalizability, and governance is commonly proxied using World Bank indicators,
introducing variation that may affect comparability and interpretation.

Therefore, the challenge is to develop a modeling approach that simultaneously:

-   Captures structural network dependencies, including reciprocity, transitivity, and
    clustering;
-   Preserves trade intensity information through weighted edges;
-   Incorporates country-level governance attributes;
-   Tests the role of institutional similarity in shaping trade patterns.

Based on these considerations, the present study addresses two main research questions.
First, it examines how countries’ governance characteristics influence the intensity of
their bilateral trade relationships. Second, it investigates how governance similarity,
along with network structural interdependencies, such as reciprocal exchange and clustered
trading patterns, shapes the overall configuration of global export ties, thereby
capturing the interdependent nature of the international trade network. For the purposes
of this study, the analysis focuses on four dimensions that are most directly relevant to
economic and institutional indicators of trade: Government Effectiveness, Regulatory
Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption, while excluding Voice and Accountability
and Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, which fall outside the scope of
the research.

**Research Question 1:** How do similarities in governance characteristics between country
pairs influence the intensity of their bilateral trade relationships?

1.  **Hypotheses H1a:** Countries with more similar levels of regulatory quality engage in
    higher-value bilateral trade.

2.  **Hypothesis H2a:** Countries with more similar levels of corruption control engage in
    higher-value bilateral trade.

When countries share comparable institutional frameworks, firms face lower coordination
and enforcement costs through contract negotiation and dispute resolution, according to
[@francois_institutions_2013; @dixit_lawlessness_2011], reducing transaction frictions and
enabling greater private-sector participation in cross-border markets. Because regulatory
quality reflects a government’s capacity to design and implement policies that support
private-sector development, institutional similarity is expected not only to increase the
likelihood of trade relationships emerging but also to enhance the intensity of existing
trade flows. By lowering firms’ adaptation costs when entering foreign markets, similar
regulatory environments facilitate deeper export integration, forming the basis for
*Hypothesis H1a* and *Hypothesis H1b.*

As noted in the [@shleifer_corruption_1993], firms also face lower enforcement costs when
corruption levels and rule-of-law standards are comparable, reducing uncertainty about
contract enforcement and thereby improving trade potential, motivating *Hypothesis H2a*.
Likewise, similarity in the rule of law reduces legal uncertainty in cross-border
transactions and mitigates the negative effects of weak contract enforcement on trade
flows [@de_groot_institutional_2004; @noauthor_role_nodate]. When both trading partners
have comparable legal systems, including strong contract enforcement and effective
property rights protection, firms can confidently enter into long-term trade relationships
and make relationship-specific investments, supporting *Hypothesis H2a* and *Hypothesis*
*H2b*.

**Research Question 2:** How do similarities in governance quality and the broader
patterns of interdependence among trading partners influence the formation and intensity
of bilateral export relationships across countries in the global economy?

1.  **Hypotheses H1b:** Countries with more similar levels of regulatory quality are
    expected to engage in higher-value bilateral trade

2.  **Hypothesis H2b:** Countries with more similar rule‐of‐law conditions are expected to
    engage in higher-value bilateral trade

3.  **Hypothesis H3b:** Bilateral export relationships are expected to display
    reciprocity, such that higher export volumes from one country to its trading partner
    are associated with higher export volumes received in return from that partner.

4.  **Hypothesis H4b:** Trade relationships exhibit transitivity, where countries are more
    likely to trade intensively with partners of their existing trading partners,
    resulting in clustered patterns of export ties

5.  **Hypothesis H5b:** Countries that already receive high levels of imports from many
    partners are likely to become attractive trade destinations, making others more likely
    to export to them

Trade networks are not random but exhibit systematic structural patterns driven by
economic, political, and strategic considerations. One key structural feature of trade
networks is reciprocity, which reflects the tendency for countries to return export flows
received from their partners [@setayesh_analysis_2022]. Reciprocal trade emerges through
several channels, including diplomatic norms, bilateral or regional trade agreements, and
mutual economic interdependence, all of which encourage balanced exchange rather than
one-sided trade flows. Research from [@noauthor_make_nodate] shows that mutual economic
dependence creates incentives for countries to maintain stable, reciprocal trade
relationships, as disruptions would harm both partners. Together, these studies provide
the theoretical foundation for *Hypothesis H3b*.

Clustering patterns are another important determinant of trade network structure,
motivating *Hypothesis H4b*. Countries within regional trade blocs (e.g., EU, ASEAN,
NAFTA) develop dense, interconnected trade relationships through harmonized regulations
and reduced non-tariff barriers [@de_groot_institutional_2004; @noauthor_pdf_2025-1],
which transitive closure is significant in service trade networks [@feng_service_2021].
Additionally, large import markets create economies of scale for exporters, justifying the
fixed costs of market entry. As a result, exporters prioritize these markets, leading to a
concentration of trade ties on high-import countries, which explains the logic behind the
core-periphery structure [@noauthor_patterns_nodate; @setayesh_analysis_2022]. This
research highlights the highly heterogeneous nature of trade connections and demonstrates
that network degree and centrality patterns matter, as a small number of countries act as
major hubs, holding a disproportionately large share of global trade flows. Consequently,
the concentration of trade ties on large import markets supports *Hypothesis H5b*.

Understanding these structural patterns is essential because they reflect systemic forces
that operate beyond bilateral or single-country characteristics, shaping the overall
architecture of the global trade.

Bilateral export relationships are expected to display reciprocity, such that higher export volumes from one country to its trading partner are associated with higher export volumes received in return from that partner
&
\texttt{mutual(alpha = 0.8)}
&
The \texttt{mutual(alpha = 0.8)} term captures the tendency for bilateral trade relationships to exhibit reciprocity, whereby higher export flows from one country are associated with higher return flows from its trading partner. Reciprocal trade reflects balanced exchange and mutual commitment, reducing asymmetric dependence and fostering more stable and sustainable trading relationships than those based on one-sided export flows

The \texttt{receiver("total\_imports")} term captures the tendency for countries with high import volumes to attract additional export ties. Large import markets signal strong demand and institutional reliability, lowering perceived risks for new exporters and generating self-reinforcing patterns in which highly connected import destinations continue to receive a disproportionate share of global exports
\\
\hline

***Control Variables:***

-   *GDP (current USD)*: Economic size is a central determinant of a country’s trade
    capacity, as consistently demonstrated in gravity-model research
    [@leitao_gravity_2024]. Larger economies tend to produce a greater volume and
    diversity of exportable goods while also generating higher import demand. Including
    GDP as a control variable accounts for these scale effects, allowing the analysis to
    isolate the contribution of governance similarity to trade intensity.

-   *Inflation Rate*: Elevated inflation can reduce export competitiveness and increase
    uncertainty in cross-border transactions. Controlling for inflation ensures that the
    estimated governance effects are not confounded by broader macroeconomic volatility.

### Connection to Previous Work and Contribution

Understanding how governance similarity shapes both the formation and intensity of trade
relationships has significant theoretical and policy implications. Institutional
similarity not only increases the likelihood of trade but also amplifies trade volumes,
indicating that policies promoting convergence, such as regulatory harmonization,
anti-corruption cooperation, or system alignment, may yield greater economic benefits than
previously recognized. Trade agreements with enforceable governance provisions can
facilitate deeper economic integration beyond tariff reduction [@horn_beyond_2010].

Second, if governance similarity strengthens reciprocity or clustering, the global trade
system may display path-dependent dynamics, where countries outside these communities face
higher barriers to integration due to network position and institutional distance rather
than formal trade restrictions [@noauthor_role_nodate]. This suggests to policymakers that
institutional convergence offers benefits beyond simply lowering transaction costs. It
enables countries to establish stronger and more resilient trade relationships within the
global economy. By aligning their institutional frameworks, countries can position
themselves more advantageously within the broader architecture of international trade.

Third, theoretically, incorporating institutional similarity into network models provides
a fuller understanding of global economic structures. Rather than viewing institutions
solely as bilateral friction reducers, this approach recognizes that institutions operate
within a complex, interdependent system where governance similarity affects not just
dyadic trade but the entire configuration of the trade network.

The remaining structure of the report is organized into four main sections. The Dataset
section outlines the sources, construction, and characteristics of the trade and
governance data, including relevant network configurations. The Research Rationale section
explains why the selected modelling approaches: MRQAP and GERGM, are well suited to the
research questions and discusses potential alternative methods. The Results section
presents and interprets the empirical findings from these models, comparing and evaluating
the outcome in relation to the proposed hypotheses. Finally, the Conclusion provides the
insights from the findings, highlights remaining challenges, and suggests paths for future
research.

## Dataset

### Dataset collection

This research combines multiple datasets that capture international trade flows, trade
facilitation indicators, economic development, and governance quality across countries.

#### Primary Dataset

The primary dataset used is the International Trade Database obtained from Kaggle, which
is compiled from UN Comtrade through the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) platform.
UN Comtrade is the official repository of international trade statistics, maintained by
the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), and serves governments, academia, and
research institutions worldwide [@uncomtrade_2025]. It covers more than 99% of the world’s
merchandise trade and provides country-reported data on international trade flows.

The dataset contains annual export values (measured in thousands of U.S. dollars) from
1988 to 2021, recording exports from a reporting country *i* to a partner country *j* in
year *t*. Each observation represents the total export value of all goods shipped from
country *i* to country *j* in a given year. For this study, the analysis focuses on data
from 2018, the year immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, as it ensures the widest
data availability and comparability across countries in terms of governance, economic
performance, and trade facilitation indicators prior to the global disruptions of the
pandemic.

#### Supplementary Data

Sources To complement the trade network with country-level attributes, three supplementary
datasets from the World Bank’s open data repositories were integrated, all extracted for
the year 2018.

1.  The Doing Business Indicators (DBI) provide detailed measures of trade facilitation
    [@worldbank_dbi_2020]. This dataset includes information on border and documentary
    compliance times and costs for both imports and exports, as well as the overall
    *Trading Across Borders* score. These indicators reflect the efficiency and costliness
    of customs procedures and border management in each country.

2.  The World Development Indicators (WDI) contain key macroeconomic measures such as GDP
    (current USD), GDP growth rate, and inflation rate [@worldbank_wdi_2025]. These
    indicators offer insights into each country’s level of economic development,
    performance, and stability.

3.  The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) capture institutional quality across several
    governance dimensions, including government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of
    law, and control of corruption [@worldbank_wgi_2024]. These measures describe the
    strength of governance systems that may influence trade relationships, institutional
    reliability, and policy effectiveness.

### Data Integration and cleaning

All datasets were joined using the country code (ISO3) as the unique key identifier. The
trade data were filtered to include only valid reporting and partner countries, excluding
aggregate or non-sovereign entities such as World, European Union, and Other Asia, etc.

The World Bank datasets were combined into a single table using inner joins, ensuring that
only countries present across all three sources were retained. Duplicate columns were
removed and variable names were standardized for clarity. 

Finally, the cleaned World Bank data were merged with the trade dataset to construct two
key network components:

-   A weighted directed edge list: representing exports from country i to country j. The
    edge attribute captures the trade value (measured in thousands of U.S. dollars),
    indicating the intensity or magnitude of the trade relationship between two countries.
    Each edge corresponds to a direct trade flow from an exporting country (reporter) to
    an importing country (partner).

-   A vertex attribute table: in which each vertex represents a country. This table
    includes country-specific attributes such as economic indicators (GDP, inflation rate,
    etc), governance quality (government effectiveness, regulatory quality, etc), and
    trade facilitation measures (border time and cost for export and import).

The resulting dataset covers 181 countries with 18940 trade links in 2018.

### Descriptive Statistics

This chapter examines the structure of international trade relationships in 2018. The data
reveals an interconnected global economy with strong reciprocal trading partnerships. The
network shows a high density (0.581) and reciprocity (0.755), indicating that most
countries engage in bilateral trade relationships rather than one-way flows. With 18,940
trade connections and very high transitivity (0.809), the data demonstrates that trading
partners form tight-knit regional and global trading clusters. The dominance of mutual
dyads (7,149) over asymmetric ones (4,641) further confirms that relationships in 2018
were predominantly two-way, reflecting the interdependent nature of the global economy.

Table 3: Network Statistics. Presents key structural metrics of the international trade
network, showing a dense and highly reciprocal structure (density = 0.581; reciprocity =
0.755) with strong clustering (transitivity = 0.809) and no isolated nodes among 181
countries.

Table 4: Dyad Census. Summarizes the distribution of dyadic relationships in the network,
indicating that most country pairs engage in mutual trade (7,149 mutual dyads) compared to
fewer asymmetric or null trade relationships.

| Mutual | Asymmetric |  Null |
|--------|-----------:|------:|
| 7,149  |      4,641 | 4,500 |

Table 5: Triad Census Reports the frequencies of triadic configurations, revealing a
predominance of fully connected triads (type 300) and reciprocated trade structures (e.g.,
111U, 120U), reflecting strong transitivity and clustering within the global trade system.

| 15583 |  405 | 66890 | 5027 | 120839 | 8840 | 100917 | 200000 |

Table 6: Dataset attributes. Summary statistics for all numerical attributes in the
dataset, including trade performance indicators, documentation and border processing
times, costs, and macroeconomic measures. The results show substantial variation across
countries, particularly in trade costs and GDP, indicating heterogeneity in trade
efficiency, economic quality, and governance quality among countries.

#### Distribution Analysis Vertices

The distribution peaks around log10 5 - 6 has a long tail extending to the right (Figure
1). This tells us most trade relationships are moderate-sized, and there are fewer
extremely large trade relationships. The highest frequency is around 5,5 to 6 which
translates to between \$316 million and \$1 billion in trade. The right tail shows some
relationships that are 100-1000x larger than typical ones. These are likely major trade
corridors.

bilateral flow in 2018. The USA features prominently as a destination for Mexican and
Canadian exports, while Hong Kong serves as a crucial intermediary for Chinese trade.
Asian manufacturing networks (Korea, Japan, China) and significant trade imbalances
characterize global commerce.

## Research Rationale

In line with recent research on trade networks, we draw on studies that employ the
Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure (MRQAP) to analyze bilateral trade
flows. For example, [@noauthor_structural_nodate] use MRQAP to identify the economic,
geographic, and logistical drivers of EU lithium-ion battery trade, while
[@hu_impacts_2023] apply the method to the global rare-earths trade network, demonstrating
that factors such as economic scale, geographical contiguity, and institutional distance
shape dyadic trading patterns. Following this literature, we adopt MRQAP to model our
trade network. MRQAP is particularly suitable because our data are network-based,
representing trade between pairs of countries. Observations are interdependent, as trade
relations are interconnected. Traditional regression methods cannot accommodate such
dependencies, but MRQAP corrects for them using permutation tests, providing statistically
valid results while including dyadic predictors such as GDP, inflation, and governance
quality.

The international trade network examined in this study consists of directed, weighted
ties, with each edge representing the value of exports from one country to another. This
structure captures both the presence and intensity of trade. Traditional Exponential
Random Graph Models (ERGMs) are well-suited for modeling network dependencies, but they
treat ties as binary, obscuring the magnitude of trade relationships. Because trade
intensity is central to understanding economic interdependence, backbone reduction or
binarization would result in substantial information loss. Consequently, the dataset
requires a modeling framework that retains continuous edge weights while simultaneously
capturing the endogenous structure of the global trade network.

### Suitability of MRQAP and GERGM

MRQAP is appropriate for our research questions because it evaluates how similarities or
differences in country attributes, such as economic performance or governance quality,
affect the strength of bilateral trade ties. It models the export network as a function of
dyadic similarities, showing whether countries with comparable characteristics trade more.
By accounting for network dependencies, MRQAP provides accurate insights into how
governance and economic factors shape global trade connections. Since RQ1 focuses on
attribute-based relationships rather than structural dependencies, MRQAP is particularly
suitable.

The Generalized Exponential Random Graph Model (GERGM) extends ERGM methodology to
continuous-valued networks, allowing weighted export flows to be analyzed while
simultaneously estimating structural network effects and country-level attributes such as
governance quality and macroeconomic conditions. GERGM is therefore well-suited to examine
how governance similarity, reciprocity, clustering, and popularity jointly shape both the
formation and intensity of export relationships. By preserving the full distribution of
trade values, GERGM provides a more realistic representation of the global trade system
than binary ERGMs, offering deeper insight into the interaction between institutional and
structural factors.

### Comparison to Alternative Methods

Traditional gravity models estimated via ordinary least squares (OLS) or Poisson
pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) are commonly used to study governance similarity and
trade. However, they assume that dyads are independent, an assumption that fails in
networked systems where reciprocity, shared partners, and clustering influence trade
patterns [@noauthor_inferential_nodate]. While governance similarity can be included in
gravity models, these models cannot account for endogenous dependencies or the interplay
between governance and network structure, and network autocorrelation can bias standard
errors [@fagiolo_international-trade_2009]. Standard ERGMs combined with binary backbone
extraction similarly discard trade intensity, depend on arbitrary filtering thresholds,
and cannot address our research questions, which concerns variation in trade magnitude
[@serrano_extracting_2009; @setayesh_analysis_2022].

In contrast, MRQAP is well-suited for testing attribute-based hypotheses, maintaining
dyadic trade values while accounting for network dependence via permutation-based
inference [@noauthor_sensitivity_nodate]. GERGM extends this by modeling continuous trade
weights alongside structural characteristics such as popularity, reciprocity, and
clustering. Together, these methods provide a theoretically coherent framework that
integrates network dynamics and governance effects, offering a more complete and precise
analysis of international trade patterns than alternative approaches.

### MRQAP – Results for Model 1

We estimate a number of MRQAP models with bilateral trade intensity between country pairs
as the dependent network in order to address Research Question 1. According to our
hypotheses, regulatory quality similarity (H1a) and corruption control similarity (H2a)
are the primary predictors that capture similarities in governance characteristics. We use
inflation dissimilarity and the dyad's mean GDP as controls in every specification. We
employ MRQAP with 5,000 QAP permutations to obtain network-robust p-values because trade
relations between dyads are not independent.

We start with two baseline models that solely take economic covariates into account. The
GDP dyadic average is included in Model 0. This model already explains about half of the
variance in bilateral trade intensity (R² ≈ 0.50), as @tbl-mrqap-fit demonstrates. This
suggests that economic size is a very strong predictor of how intensely countries trade.
According to the permu, the GDP_mean coefficient is large, positive, and highly
significant in all models (about 0.31).

Model 1 incorporates differences in inflation between pairs of countries. Dyads with more
similar inflation rates typically engage in more intense trading, as indicated by the
negative coefficient on Inflation_diff. Its two-tailed permutation p-value, however, is
only marginally significant (between 0.07 and 0.09), indicating that this relationship is
not as strong as the GDP effect. The overall fit is barely affected by the inclusion of
inflation dissimilarity: When compared to the GDP-only baseline, R2 rises slightly and
mean squared error (MSE) falls slightly, but AIC and BIC values only slightly improve
(@tbl-mrqap-fit).

To test H1a, we next present our first governance similarity metric, regulatory quality
similarity. Higher values indicate more similar regulatory environments because this
variable (RegQual_similarity) is calculated as the negative absolute difference between
the standardised regulatory quality scores of various nations. The strong positive effect
of GDP_mean and the weak negative effect of Inflation_diff are essentially unchanged in
Model H1a (not shown separately), while the coefficient on RegQual_similarity is positive
but very small in magnitude and statistically non-significant. In comparison to the purely
economic baseline, adding regulatory quality similarity hardly affects R2, MSE, AIC, or
BIC, according to the model fit statistics in @tbl-mrqap-fit.

Lastly, the governance similarity metrics RegQual_similarity and CorrControl_similarity
are included in Model 1 MRQAP (Model H1a+H2a in @tbl-mrqap-fit). The complete set of
coefficients is reported in @tbl-mrqap-coefs. Once more, the RegQual_similarity estimate
is small and positive (\~ 0.013), whereas the CorrControl_similarity estimate is small and
negative (\~ –0.012). Crucially, after controlling for GDP and inflation, both
coefficients have comparatively large two-tailed permutation p-values (approximately 0.11
and 0.10, respectively), suggesting that neither effect is statistically significant at
conventional levels. On the other hand, Inflation_diff continues to show a slight
negative, marginally significant effect, and GDP_mean maintains a strong, highly
significant positive association with trade intensity.

@tbl-mrqap-coefs summarizes the MRQAP estimates for Model 1, focusing on the two
governance similarity terms and the controls.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-mrqap-coefs
#| tbl-cap: "MRQAP Model 1: Bilateral trade intensity regressed on governance similarity and controls."
#| echo: false

library(tibble)
library(dplyr)

# Build a coefficient table directly from the netlm object
coef_mat <- cbind(
  Estimate    = mod_H1a_H2a$coefficients,
  `Pr(<=b)`   = mod_H1a_H2a$pleeq,
  `Pr(>=b)`   = mod_H1a_H2a$pgreq,
  `Pr(>=|b|)` = mod_H1a_H2a$pgreqabs
)

coef_table <- coef_mat |>
  as.data.frame() |>
  rownames_to_column("Term")

knitr::kable(coef_table, digits = 3)
```

The estimated coefficients from Model 1 (not including the intercept) are shown in Figure
@fig-mrqap-coefs. With a significantly larger positive bar than any other term, the plot
emphasises GDP_mean's dominant role. A weaker effect is indicated by the Inflation_diff
bar, which is negative and noticeably smaller. The absolute value of the bars for
RegQual_similarity and CorrControl_similarity is nearly zero, which graphically supports
their lack of a significant and statistical influence on trade intensity.

To assess overall model performance more systematically, we compare mean squared error
(MSE), R², AIC and BIC across the four specifications (baseline with GDP only, baseline
plus inflation, H1a, and H1a+H2a). @tbl-mrqap-fit shows these metrics.

```{r}

  y_hat <- mod$fitted.values        # predicted values

  y     <- y_hat + e                # reconstruct response

  n <- length(y)                    # number of observations

  sse <- sum(e^2)

  sst <- sum((y - mean(y))^2)
  r2  <- 1 - sse / sst

  # Gaussian AIC/BIC based on residual variance
  aic <- n * log(sse / n) + 2 * k
  bic <- n * log(sse / n) + k * log(n)

  list(MSE = mse, R2 = r2, AIC = aic, BIC = bic)
}

fit0    <- get_fit_stats(mod0)
fit1    <- get_fit_stats(mod1)
fit_H1a <- get_fit_stats(mod_H1a)
fit_H2  <- get_fit_stats(mod_H1a_H2a)

model_fit <- tibble(
  Model = c("Baseline (GDP)", 
            "Baseline + Inflation", 
            "H1a: +Reg. quality similarity", 
            "H1a+H2a: +Corr. control similarity"),
  MSE = c(fit0$MSE,
          fit1$MSE,
          fit_H1a$MSE,
          fit_H2$MSE),
  R2  = c(fit0$R2,
          fit1$R2,
          fit_H1a$R2,
          fit_H2$R2),
  AIC = c(fit0$AIC,
          fit1$AIC,
          fit_H1a$AIC,
          fit_H2$AIC),
  BIC = c(fit0$BIC,
          fit1$BIC,
          fit_H1a$BIC,
          fit_H2$BIC)
)

knitr::kable(model_fit, digits = 3)
```

The model comparison in @tbl-mrqap-fit demonstrates that, in addition to the economic
controls, governance similarity adds minimal explanatory power. When switching from the
baseline models to the governance-augmented models, improvements in MSE, AIC, and BIC are
minimal, and R2 stays near 0.50 for all four specifications. This implies that rather than
similarity in the two governance dimensions taken into consideration, economic size (and
to a lesser extent, inflation differences) accounts for the majority of the explainable
variation in bilateral trade intensity in our data.

To visualize the contributions of the different predictors in Model 1, Figure
@fig-mrqap-coefs plots the estimated coefficients (excluding the intercept). This
highlights the relative magnitude and direction of the effects.

```{r}
#| label: fig-mrqap-coefs
#| fig-cap: "Estimated coefficients from MRQAP Model 1 (excluding intercept)."
#| echo: false

coef_plot <- coef_table |>

ggplot(coef_plot, aes(x = Term, y = Estimate)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Coefficient (change in trade intensity)",
    title = "MRQAP Model 1 coefficients"
  )
```

The estimated coefficients from Model 1 (not including the intercept) are shown in Figure
@fig-mrqap-coefs. With a significantly larger positive bar than any other term, the plot
emphasises GDP_mean's dominant role. A weaker effect is indicated by the Inflation_diff
bar, which is negative and noticeably smaller. The absolute value of the bars for
RegQual_similarity and CorrControl_similarity is nearly zero, which graphically supports
their lack of a significant and statistical influence on trade intensity.

When combined, these MRQAP findings only partially support Research Question 1. Economic
fundamentals clearly influence the intensity of bilateral trade: country pairs with higher
combined GDP trade significantly more, and there is some evidence that stronger trade ties
are linked to macroeconomic similarity (lower inflation differences). However, once these
economic factors are considered, we find no evidence that similarities in regulatory
quality or corruption control, as measured here, result in systematically higher trade
intensity. As a result, the MRQAP analysis does not support either H1a or H2a. The primary
drivers of variation in bilateral trade intensity in this network seem to be basic
economic capacity and modest macroeconomic stability rather than governance similarity.
