	abstract = {This paper studies the effect of institutions on trade flows, using a gravity model approach. Standard gravity equations incorporate factors such as geographical proximity, language, trade policy and common history as explanatory factors for variation in bilateral trade that reflect the costs of trade across geographical and cultural distance. We extend this type of analysis by focusing on the relevance of the quality of governance and the extent of familiarity with the resulting framework of rules and norms in explaining variation in bilateral trade patterns. More specifically, we test whether institutional homogeneity and institutional quality have an independent impact on the trade volume between pairs of countries. We find that having a similar institutional framework promotes bilateral trade by 13\%, on average. Furthermore, a better quality of formal institutions tends to coincide with more trade. Depending on being either importer or exporter, an increase in overall institutional quality of one standard deviation from the mean leads to an estimated increase of 30–44\% in bilateral trade.},

	abstract = {Does good governance matter for exporting to the highly competitive markets of developed countries, especially those committed to a developmental mission centered on promoting good governance? This paper is investigating this research question. The focus of the analysis is the case study of Arab exports to the German economy, where a comparatively poor performance in comparison to that of other regions of the world is witnessed, despite geographical proximity and preferential trade agreements. Using statistical data and the literature on the subject, the paper engages in a discussion on German trade flows from Arab countries and whether governance indicators provide a good explanatory framework. The research question is then investigated empirically by running several regressions using the two-stage least-squares and Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood models. Different indicators of German exports are used as dependent variables while the independent variables are various governance indicators together with the control variables suggested by the gravity model. The obtained empirical results suggest that good governance generally boosts Arab exports to Germany and relatively more than it does for non-Arab exporters to Germany. This is especially true for governance indicators that directly affect exporting activities, such as regulatory quality and government effectiveness. For some indicators that indirectly affect exporting, however, the results are mixed for both Arab and non-Arab countries, especially for the textile industry. This sheds doubts on Germany’s developmental commitment to fostering good governance principles.},

Many have hypothesised that Chinese economic actors undermine the global drive to promote good governance in developing countries, and in Africa in particular, by disproportionately engaging economically with countries that suffer from poor governance outcomes. Using bilateral trade data, this paper explicitly compares how different aspects of African countries' governance levels impact their trade patterns with China and the West. It finds that African countries with better corruption controls and improved democratic development levels export more to the Western countries sampled, though the opposite is true with regard to their exports to China. Interestingly, democratic development is associated with greater imports from both the West and China, but the opposite holds with regard to respect for human rights. Finally, political stability has no significant impact on African trade—with either the West or China. However, when oil exporters are excluded from the sample, the relationship between political stability and African exports strengthens dramatically, which suggests that both Western and Chinese importers are willing to tolerate political instability to secure oil.{\textless}/jats:p{\textgreater}},

The study divides the contents of all PTAs involving the EC and the US currently notified to the WTO, into 14 ‘WTO+’ and 38 ‘WTO-X’ areas, where WTO+ provisions come under the current mandate of the WTO, and WTO-X provisions deal with issues lying outside the current WTO mandate. As a second step, the legal enforceability of each obligation is evaluated, and judged on the extent to which the text specifies clear obligations. Among the findings are: (i) EC agreements contain almost four times as many instances of WTO-X provisions as do US agreements; (ii) but EC agreements evidence a very significant amount of ‘legal inflation’ (i.e. non-legally enforceable provisions) in the WTO-X category, and US agreements actually contain more enforceable WTO-X provisions than do the EC agreements; (iii) US agreements tend to emphasise regulatory areas more compared to EC agreements.},

	abstract = {Despite the effectiveness of the observed barriers such as taxes and quotas to adjust bilateral trade, they are still not well supported by governments in general and the World Trade Organization in particular. Therefore, in recent years, unobserved barriers have been critical tools to modify the trade flows between nations worldwide. China’s exports account for a massive proportion of global trade. However, the role of cultural and institutional distance in China’s trade flow has not been much explored. This study analyzes the impact of cultural and institutional differences on China's exports between 2006-2017 by adopting a system-GMM estimator. The main findings are, first, that cultural and institutional differences between China and its trading partners reduce China's exports. Second, cultural and institutional distances have the strongest influence on China's exports to high-income countries, followed by low-income countries, and finally middle-income countries. Third, manufactured products are the most sensitive to cultural and institutional distances. Based on these findings, several policies for China, as well as for emerging economies in general, are suggested for reducing cultural and institutional distances and boosting their exports.

	abstract = {How can property rights be protected and contracts be enforced in countries where the rule of law is ineffective or absent? How can firms from advanced market economies do business in such circumstances? InLawlessness and Economics, Avinash Dixit examines the theory of private institutions that transcend or supplement weak economic governance from the state.In much of the world and through much of history, private mechanisms--such as long-term relationships, arbitration, social networks to disseminate information and norms to impose sanctions, and for-profit enforcement services--have grown up in place of formal, state-governed institutions. Even in countries with strong legal systems, many of these mechanisms continue under the shadow of the law. Numerous case studies and empirical investigations have demonstrated the variety, importance, and merits, and drawbacks of such institutions.This book builds on these studies and constructs a toolkit of theoretical models to analyze them. The models shed new conceptual light on the different modes of governance, and deepen our understanding of the interaction of the alternative institutions with each other and with the government's law. For example, one model explains the limit on the size of social networks and illuminates problems in the transition to more formal legal systems as economies grow beyond this limit. Other models explain why for-profit enforcement is inefficient. The models also help us understand why state law dovetails with some non-state institutions and collides with others. This can help less-developed countries and transition economies devise better processes for the introduction or reform of their formal legal systems.},

	doi = {10.1057/s41599-025-05341-6},
	abstract = {This study investigates the evolutionary process of the global agricultural trade network and identifies key influencing factors. Utilizing social network analysis, a trade network model was constructed based on international trade data for six categories of agricultural products from 2013 to 2022. Comparative analyses were conducted from three perspectives: individual node characteristics, network pattern evolution and network community structure. Additionally, an Exponential Random Graph Model was employed to discern the critical determinants of agricultural trade networks. The study also discussed the differentiated performances observed in regions with varying levels of development. The findings indicate that: (1) In terms of individual node characteristics, core countries in agricultural trade are relatively stable, predominantly located in European, American, and a few Asian countries, with an expanding gap among nations. (2) Regarding network topology, all agricultural product trade networks exhibit small-world properties, with distinct geographical characteristics in major communities. (3) As for the influencing factors of the trade network, reciprocity, geographical proximity, cultural differences, and trade agreements significantly enhance trade connections across various agricultural products. The similarity effect of GDP per capita exerts a negative impact on agricultural trade, except for textile raw materials. Agricultural endowment and governance efficiency play a significant role in a country’s agricultural exports.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the effect of institutions on trade flows, using a gravity model approach. Standard gravity equations incorporate factors such as geographical proximity, language, trade policy and common history as explanatory factors for variation in bilateral trade that reflect the costs of trade across geographical and cultural distance. We extend this type of analysis by focusing on the relevance of the quality of governance and the extent of familiarity with the resulting framework of rules and norms in explaining variation in bilateral trade patterns. More specifically, we test whether institutional homogeneity and institutional quality have an independent impact on the trade volume between pairs of countries. We find that having a similar institutional framework promotes bilateral trade by 13\%, on average. Furthermore, a better quality of formal institutions tends to coincide with more trade. Depending on being either importer or exporter, an increase in overall institutional quality of one standard deviation from the mean leads to an estimated increase of 30-44\% in bilateral trade.

	abstract = {Is world trade becoming more regionalized, as a result of preferential arrangements such as NAFTA, the Andean Pact and MERCOSUR? If so, is this deviation from the principle of MFN (non-discriminatory trade policies) good or bad? This paper attempts to answer both questions. Using the gravity model to examine bilateral trade patterns throughout the world, we find evidence of trading blocs in the Western Hemisphere and elsewhere, as in earlier work. Intra-regional trade is greater than could be explained by natural determinants: the proximity of a pair of countries, their sizes and GNP/capitas, and whether they share a common border or a common language. Within the Western Hemisphere, MERCOSUR and the Andean Pact countries appear to function as significantly independent trading areas, but NAFTA much less so (as of 1990). The intra-regional trade bias within MERCOSUR increased the most rapidly during the 1980s. In East Asia, on the other hand, increased intra-regional trade can be explained entirely by the rapid growth of the economies. We then turn from the econometrics to an analysis of economic welfare. Krugman has supplied an argument against a world of three trading blocs (that they would be protectionist), in a model that assumes no transport costs. He has supplied another argument in favor of trading blocs, provided the blocs are drawn along ‘natural’ geographic lines, in a model that assumes prohibitively high transportation costs between continents. In this paper we attempt to resolve the Krugman vs. Krugman debate. We complete the model of the welfare implications of trading blocs for the realistic case where inter-continental transport costs are neither so high as to be prohibitive nor zero. We consider three applications of the model. 1.Continental Free Trade Areas (FTAs). We show that it is not only Krugman's ‘unnatural’ FTAs that can leave everyone worse off than under MFN, but that under conditions of relatively low inter-continental transport costs, FTAs that are formed along natural continental lines can do so as well. We call such welfare-reducing blocs super-natural.2.Partial regionalization. We find that partial liberalization within a regional Preferential Trading Arrangement (PTA) is better than 100 percent liberalization. In the super-natural zone the regional trading arrangement, in contrast to the Article 24 provision of the GATT, reduces welfare. It occurs for combinations of low inter-continental transport costs and high intra-bloc preferences, i.e., when the regionalization of trade policy exceeds what is justified by natural factors.3.The formation of several sub-regional PTAs on each continent. We find that multiple FTAs on each continent could lower welfare, but that multiple PTAs, with partial internal liberalization, would raise welfare. We conclude the paper with an attempt to extract estimates of transportation costs from the statistics. Estimates suggest that trading blocs on the order of the EC are in fact super-natural.},

Using complex network method and temporal exponential random graph models, we constructed the Belt and Road service trade networks (BR-STNs) and global service trade networks (G-STNs) in 2010–2017, systematically analysed the features of BR-STNs compared with G-STNs, and tested the factors affecting their evolution. We find that (a) the scale of BR-STNs is small, but potential is huge. The BR-STNs present the features of small-world, larger degree disassortativity, lower reciprocity, and smaller heterogeneity than G-STNs. (b) The BR-STNs are divided into three communities and their pattern is more stable than G-STNs. (c) Luxembourg, Italy and Singapore are the core in BR-STNs, but there is a gap compared with the USA, the UK and Germany. (d) Reciprocity, structural embeddedness, the clustering effect and stability play important roles in the evolution of BR-STNs and these effects increased after the proposal of the BRI. Economy-pairs with similar trade openness, urbanization rates and quality of institution, and with different GDP and per capita GDP are more likely to trade. Countries with higher GDP, trade openness or quality of institution are active. Sharing a language, religion, colonial relationship or border, signing regional trade agreements and using a common currency facilitate service trade between countries in BR.},

	abstract = {Rare earth elements (REEs) are indispensable for the manufacture of high-tech products. Exports decline in China’s REEs primary materials (REEs-PMs) have attracted wide concern owing to China’s key role in the global REEs supply chains. The prevalence of trade frictions between countries motivates us to evaluate the potential impacts of China’s REEs-PMs exports decline. In this context, this study reviews dynamic patterns in the global REEs-PMs trade network from 1990 to 2019. Unlike previous studies, we propose a shock propagation model to evaluate the potential influence of China’s exports decline on other countries while accounting for each country’s shock adaptive capability. Specifically, countries may adjust their trade as a nonlinear function of the original trade level and key drivers of the REEs-PMs trade. Countries can partially absorb shocks by adjusting their domestic production, while the remainder is spread to their trade partners. The corresponding key drivers of the global REEs-PMs trade are revealed through a multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure (MR-QAP). The results indicate that economic scale, contiguity, and geodesic, economic, and institutional distance are the main drivers of REEs-PMs trade between countries. The most directly and indirectly affected countries are located mainly in Asia and Europe. It is worth noting that the long-term impacts of decreasing China’s REEs-PMs exports are quite limited in terms of dealing with trade frictions. Finally, several policy implications are provided for different countries with a view to maintaining the stability of the global REEs-PMs trade.},

	abstract = {A large number of complex systems find a natural abstraction in the form of weighted networks whose nodes represent the elements of the system and the weighted edges identify the presence of an interaction and its relative strength. In recent years, the study of an increasing number of large scale networks has highlighted the statistical heterogeneity of their interaction pattern, with degree and weight distributions which vary over many orders of magnitude. These features, along with the large number of elements and links, make the extraction of the truly relevant connections forming the network's backbone a very challenging problem. More specifically, coarse-graining approaches and filtering techniques are at struggle with the multiscale nature of large scale systems. Here we define a filtering method that offers a practical procedure to extract the relevant connection backbone in complex multiscale networks, preserving the edges that represent statistical significant deviations with respect to a null model for the local assignment of weights to edges. An important aspect of the method is that it does not belittle small-scale interactions and operates at all scales defined by the weight distribution. We apply our method to real world network instances and compare the obtained results with alternative backbone extraction techniques.},

We then compare the topological properties of the original and residual ITNs. We find that the residual ITN displays, unlike the original one, marked signatures of a complex system, and is characterized by a very different topological architecture. Whereas the original ITN is geographically clustered and organized around a few large-sized hubs, the residual ITN displays many small-sized but trade-oriented countries that, independently of their geographical position, either play the role of local hubs or attract large and rich countries in relatively complex trade-interaction patterns.},
